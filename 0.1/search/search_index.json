Custom methods refer to API methods besides the 5 standard methods. They should only be used for functionality that cannot be easily expressed via standard methods. In general, API designers should choose standard methods over custom methods whenever feasible. Standard Methods have simpler and well-defined semantics that most developers are familiar with, so they are easier to use and less error prone. Another advantage of standard methods is the API platform has better understanding and support for standard methods, such as error handling, logging, monitoring. A custom method can be associated with a resource, a collection, or a service. It may take an arbitrary request and return an arbitrary response, and also supports streaming request and response. Custom method names must follow method naming conventions . HTTP Mapping For custom methods, they should use the following generic HTTP mapping: https://service.name/v1/some/resource/name:customVerb The reason to use : instead of / to separate the custom verb from the resource name is to support arbitrary paths. For example, undelete a file can map to POST /files/a/long/file/name:undelete The following guidelines shall be applied when choosing the HTTP mapping: Custom methods should use HTTP POST verb since it has the most flexible semantics, except for methods serving as an alternative get or list which may use GET when possible. (See third bullet for specifics.) Custom methods should not use HTTP PATCH , but may use other HTTP verbs. In such cases, the methods must follow the standard HTTP semantics for that verb. Notably, custom methods using HTTP GET must be idempotent and have no side effects. For example custom methods that implement special views on the resource should use HTTP GET . The request message field(s) receiving the resource name of the resource or collection with which the custom method is associated should map to the URL path. The URL path must end with a suffix consisting of a colon followed by the custom verb . If the HTTP verb used for the custom method allows an HTTP request body (this applies to POST , PUT , PATCH , or a custom HTTP verb), the HTTP configuration of that custom method must use the body: \"*\" clause and all remaining request message fields shall map to the HTTP request body. If the HTTP verb used for the custom method does not accept an HTTP request body ( GET , DELETE ), the HTTP configuration of such method must not use the body clause at all, and all remaining request message fields shall map to the URL query parameters. Warning If a service implements multiple APIs, the API producer must carefully create the service configuration to avoid custom verb conflicts between APIs. Use Cases Some additional scenarios where custom methods may be the right choice: Batch methods. For performance critical methods, it may be useful to provide custom batch methods to reduce per-request overhead. A few examples where a standard method is a better fit than a custom method: Query resources with different query parameters (use standard list method with standard list filtering). Simple resource property change (use standard update method with field mask). Dismiss a notification (use standard delete method). Common Custom Methods The curated list of commonly used or useful custom method names is below. API designers should consider these names before introducing their own to facilitate consistency across APIs. Method Name Custom verb HTTP verb Note Cancel :cancel POST Cancel an outstanding operation, such as operations.cancel . BatchGet :batchGet GET Batch get of multiple resources. See details in the description of List . Move :move POST Move a resource from one parent to another, such as folders.move . Search :search GET Alternative to List for fetching data that does not adhere to List semantics, such as services.search .

Empty Responses The standard Delete method should return Empty , unless it is performing a \"soft\" delete, in which case the method should return the resource with its state updated to indicate the deletion in progress. For custom methods, they should have their own XxxResponse messages even if they are empty, because it is very likely their functionality will grow over time and need to return additional data. Representing Ranges Fields that represent ranges should use half-open intervals with naming convention [start_xxx, end_xxx) , such as [start_key, end_key) or [start_time, end_time) . Half-open interval semantics is commonly used by C++ STL library and Java standard library. APIs should avoid using other ways of representing ranges, such as (index, count) , or [first, last] . Resource Labels In a resource-oriented API, the resource schema is defined by the API. To let the client attach small amount of simple metadata to the resources (for example, tagging a virtual machine resource as a database server), APIs should add a field Dict[str, str] labels to the resource definition: class Table: metadata: Dict[str, str] Long Running Operations If an API method typically takes a long time to complete, it can be designed to return a Long Running Operation resource to the client, which the client can use to track the progress and receive the result. The Operation defines a standard interface to work with long running operations. Individual APIs must not define their own interfaces for long running operations to avoid inconsistency. The operation resource must be returned directly as the response message and any immediate consequence of the operation should be reflected in the API. For example, when creating a resource, that resource should appear in LIST and GET methods though the resource should indicate that it is not ready for use. When the operation is complete, the Operation.response field should contain the message that would have been returned directly, if the method was not long running. An operation can provide information about its progress using the Operation.metadata field. An API should define a message for this metadata even if the initial implementation does not populate the metadata field. List Pagination Listable collections should support pagination, even if results are typically small. Rationale : If an API does not support pagination from the start, supporting it later is troublesome because adding pagination breaks the API's behavior. Clients that are unaware that the API now uses pagination could incorrectly assume that they received a complete result, when in fact they only received the first page. To support pagination (returning list results in pages) in a List method, the API shall : define a string field page_token in the List method's request message. The client uses this field to request a specific page of the list results. define an int field page_size in the List method's request message. Clients use this field to specify the maximum number of results to be returned by the server. The server may further constrain the maximum number of results returned in a single page. If the page_size is 0 , the server will decide the number of results to be returned. define a string field next_page_token in the List method's response message. This field represents the pagination token to retrieve the next page of results. If the value is \"\" , it means no further results for the request. To retrieve the next page of results, client shall pass the value of response's next_page_token in the subsequent List method call (in the request message's page_token field): rpc ListBooks(ListBooksRequest) returns (ListBooksResponse); class TablesRequest: page_size: int page_token: str class ListBooksResponse: tables: List[Tables] next_page_token: str When clients pass in query parameters in addition to a page token, the service must fail the request if the query parameters are not consistent with the page token. Page token contents should be a url-safe base64 encoded. This allows the contents to evolve without compatibility issues. If the page token contains potentially sensitive information, that information should be encrypted. Services must prevent tampering with page tokens from exposing unintended data through one of the following methods: require query parameters to be respecified on follow up requests. only reference server-side session state in the page token. encrypt and sign the query parameters in the page token and revalidate and reauthorize these parameters on every call. An implementation of pagination may also provide the total count of items in an int field named total_size . List Sub-Collections Sometimes, an API needs to let a client List/Search across sub- collections. For example, the Raw API has a collection of databases, and each database has a collection of tables, and a client wants to search for a table across all databases. In such cases, it is recommended to use standard List on the sub-collection and specify the wildcard collection id \"-\" for the parent collection(s). For the Library API example, we can use the following REST API request: GET https://raw.alinea.io/v1/databases/-/tables?filter=xxx Note the reason to choose \"-\" instead of \"*\" is to avoid the need for URL escaping. Get Unique Resource From Sub-Collection Sometimes, a resource within a sub-collection has an identifier that is unique within its parent collection(s). In this case, it may be useful to allow a Get to retrieve that resource without knowing which parent collection contains it. In such cases, it is recommended to use a standard Get on the resource and specify the wildcard collection id \"-\" for all parent collections within which the resource is unique. For example, in the Raw API, we can use the following REST API request, if the table is unique among all databases: GET https://raw.alinea.io/v1/databases/-/tables/{id} Sorting Order If an API method lets client specify sorting order for list results, the request message should contain a field: order_by: str = ...; The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For example: \"foo,bar\" . The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix \" desc\" should be appended to the field name. For example: \"foo desc,bar\" . Redundant space characters in the syntax are insignificant. \"foo,bar desc\" and \" foo , bar desc \" are equivalent. Request Validation If an API method has side effects and there is a need to validate the request without causing such side effects, the request message should contain a field: validate_only: bool = ...; If this field is set to true , the server must not execute any side effects and only perform implementation-specific validation consistent with the full request. If validation succeeds, Code.OK must be returned and any full request using the same request message should not return Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT . Note that the request may still fail due to other errors such as Code.ALREADY_EXISTS or because of race conditions. Request Duplication For network APIs, idempotent API methods are highly preferred, because they can be safely retried after network failures. However, some API methods cannot easily be idempotent, such as creating a resource, and there is a need to avoid unnecessary duplication. For such use cases, the request message should contain a unique ID, like a UUID, which the server will use to detect duplication and make sure the request is only processed once. // A unique request ID for server to detect duplicated requests. // This field **should** be named as `request_id`. request_id: str = ...; If a duplicate request is detected, the server should return the response for the previously successful request, because the client most likely did not receive the previous response. Enum Default Value Every enum definition must start with a 0 valued entry, which shall be used when an enum value is not explicitly specified. APIs must document how 0 values are handled. The enum value 0 should be named as ENUM_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED . If there is a common default behavior, then it shall be used when an enum value is not explicitly specified. If there is no common default behavior, then the 0 value should be rejected with error INVALID_ARGUMENT when used. An idiomatic name may be used for the 0 value. For example, Code.OK is the idiomatic way of specifying the absence of an error code. In this case, OK is semantically equivalent to UNSPECIFIED in the context of the enum type. In cases where an intrinsically sensible and safe default exists, that value may be used for the '0' value. For example, BASIC is the '0' value in the Resource View enum. Grammar Syntax In API designs, it is often necessary to define simple grammars for certain data formats, such as acceptable text input. To provide a consistent developer experience across APIs and reduce learning curve, API designers must use the following variant of Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) syntax to define such grammars: Production = name \"=\" [ Expression ] \";\" ; Expression = Alternative { \"|\" Alternative } ; Alternative = Term { Term } ; Term = name | TOKEN | Group | Option | Repetition ; Group = \"(\" Expression \")\" ; Option = \"[\" Expression \"]\" ; Repetition = \"{\" Expression \"}\" ; Note TOKEN represents terminal symbols defined outside the grammar. Integer Types In API designs, unsigned integer types such as uint32 and fixed32 should not be used because some important programming languages and systems don't support them well, such as Java, JavaScript and OpenAPI. And they are more likely to cause overflow errors. Another issue is that different APIs are very likely to use mismatched signed and unsigned types for the same thing. When signed integer types are used for things where the negative values are not meaningful, such as size or timeout, the value -1 (and only -1 ) may be used to indicate special meaning, such as end of file (EOF), infinite timeout, unlimited quota limit, or unknown age. Such usages must be clearly documented to avoid confusion. API producers should also document the behavior of the implicit default value 0 if it is not very obvious. Partial Response Sometimes an API client only needs a specific subset of data in the response message. To support such use cases, some API platforms provide native support for partial responses. Google API Platform supports it through response field mask. For any REST API call, there is an implicit system query parameter $fields , which is the JSON representation of a FieldMask value. The response message will be filtered by the $fields before being sent back to the client. This logic is handled automatically for all API methods by the API Platform. GET https://raw.alinea.api/v1/databases?$fields=database.name GET https://raw.alinea.io/v1/databases/123?$fields=name Note This logic always uses the response structure as the root for the field mask. Resource View To reduce network traffic, it is sometimes useful to allow the client to limit which parts of the resource the server should return in its responses, returning a view of the resource instead of the full resource representation. The resource view support in an API is implemented by adding a parameter to the method request which allows the client to specify which view of the resource it wants to receive in the response. The parameter: should be of an enum type must be named view Each value of the enumeration defines which parts of the resource (which fields) will be returned in the server's response. Exactly what is returned for each view value is implementation-defined and should be specified in the API documentation. class TableView(Enum): BASIC = 0 ADVANCED = 1 This construct will be mapped to URLs such as: GET https://raw.alinea.io/v1/databases/database1/tables?view=BASIC You can find out more about defining methods, requests, and responses in the Standard Methods chapter of this Design Guide. ETags An ETag is an opaque identifier allowing a client to make conditional requests. To support ETags, an API should include a string field etag in the resource definition, and its semantics must match the common usage of ETag. Normally, etag contains the fingerprint of the resource computed by the server. See Wikipedia and RFC 7232 for more details. ETags can be either strongly or weakly validated, where weakly validated ETags are prefixed with W/ . In this context, strong validation means that two resources bearing the same ETag have both byte-for-byte identical content and identical extra fields (ie, Content-Type). This means that strongly validated ETags permit for caching of partial responses to be assembled later. Conversely, resources bearing the same weakly validated ETag value means that the representations are semantically equivalent, but not necessarily byte-for-byte identical, and therefore not suitable for response caching of byte-range requests. For example: // This is a strong ETag, including the quotes. \"1a2f3e4d5b6c7c\" // This is a weak ETag, including the prefix and quotes. W/\"1a2b3c4d5ef\" It's important to understand that the quotes really are part of the ETag value, and must be present in order to conform with RFC 7232 . This means that JSON representations of ETags end up escaping the quotes. For example, the ETags would be represented in JSON resource bodies as: // Strong { \"etag\": \"\\\"1a2f3e4d5b6c7c\\\"\", \"name\": \"...\", ... } // Weak { \"etag\": \"W/\\\"1a2b3c4d5ef\\\"\", \"name\": \"...\", ... } Summary of permitted characters in ETags: Printable ASCII only Non-ASCII characters permitted by RFC 2732, but are less developer-friendly No spaces No double quotes other than in the positions shown above Avoid backslashes as recommended by RFC 7232 to prevent confusion over escaping Output Fields APIs may want to distinguish between fields that are provided by the client as inputs and fields that are only returned by the server on output on a particular resource. Note that if output only fields are set in the request or included in a FieldMask , the server must accept the request without error. The server must ignore the presence of output only fields and any indication of it. The reason for this recommendation is because clients often reuse resources returned by the server as another request input, e.g. a retrieved Book will be later reused in an UPDATE method. If output only fields are validated against, then this places extra work on the client to clear out output only fields. Singleton Resources A singleton resource can be used when only a single instance of a resource exists within its parent resource (or within the API, if it has no parent). The standard Create and Delete methods must be omitted for singleton resources; the singleton is implicitly created or deleted when its parent is created or deleted (and implicitly exists if it has no parent). The resource must be accessed using the standard Get and Update methods, as well as any custom methods that are appropriate for your use case. For example, an API with User resources could expose per-user settings as a Settings singleton. Streaming Half-Close For any bi-directional or client-streaming APIs, the server should rely on the client-initiated half-close, to complete the client-side stream. There is no need to define an explicit completion message. Any information that the client needs to send prior to the half-close must be defined as part of the request message. Domain-scoped names A domain-scoped name is an entity name that is prefixed by a DNS domain name to prevent name collisions. It is a useful design pattern when different organizations define their entity names in a decentralized manner. The syntax resembles a URI without a scheme. Domain-scoped names are widely used among Google APIs and Kubernetes APIs, such as: The Protobuf Any type representation: type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Any Stackdriver metric types: compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization Label keys: cloud.googleapis.com/location Kubernetes API versions: networking.k8s.io/v1 The kind field in the x-kubernetes-group-version-kind OpenAPI extension. Bool vs. Enum vs. String When designing an API method, it is very common to provide a set of choices for a specific feature, such as enabling tracing or disabling caching. The common way to achieve this is to introduce a request field of bool , enum , or string type. It is not always obvious what is the right type to use for a given use case. The recommended choice is as follows: Using bool type if we want to have a fixed design and intentionally don't want to extend the functionality. For example, bool enable_tracing or bool enable_pretty_print . Using an enum type if we want to have a flexible design but don't expect the design will change often. The rule of thumb is the enum definition will only change once a year or less often. For example, enum TlsVersion or enum HttpVersion . Using string type if we have an open ended design or the design can be changed frequently by an external standard. The supported values must be clearly documented. For example: string region_code as defined by Unicode regions . string language_code as defined by Unicode locales . Data Retention When designing an API service, data retention is a critical aspect of service reliability. It is common that user data is mistakenly deleted by software bugs or human errors. Without data retention and corresponding undelete functionality, a simple mistake can cause catastrophic business impact. In general, we recommend the following data retention policy for API services: For user metadata, user settings, and other important information, there should be 30-day data retention. For example, monitoring metrics, project metadata, and service definitions. For large-volume user content, there should be 7-day data retention. For example, binary blobs and database tables. For transient state or expensive storage, there should be 1-day data retention if feasible. For example, memcache instances and Redis servers. During the data retention window, the data can be undeleted without data loss. Large Payloads Networked APIs often depend on multiple network layers for their data path. Most network layers have hard limits on the request and response size. 32MB is a commonly used limit in many systems. When designing an API method that handles payloads larger than 10MB, we should carefully choose the right strategy for usability and future growth. For Google APIs, we recommend to use either streaming or media upload/download to handle large payloads. With streaming, the server incrementally handles the large data synchronously. With media, the large data flows through a large storage system, such as Google Cloud Storage, and the server can handle the data asynchronously.","title":"Design Patterns"},{"location":"standardization/apis/design-paterns/#empty-responses","text":"The standard Delete method should return Empty , unless it is performing a \"soft\" delete, in which case the method should return the resource with its state updated to indicate the deletion in progress.

The Operation defines a standard interface to work with long running operations. Individual APIs must not define their own interfaces for long running operations to avoid inconsistency. The operation resource must be returned directly as the response message and any immediate consequence of the operation should be reflected in the API. For example, when creating a resource, that resource should appear in LIST and GET methods though the resource should indicate that it is not ready for use. When the operation is complete, the Operation.response field should contain the message that would have been returned directly, if the method was not long running. An operation can provide information about its progress using the Operation.metadata field.

Rationale : If an API does not support pagination from the start, supporting it later is troublesome because adding pagination breaks the API's behavior. Clients that are unaware that the API now uses pagination could incorrectly assume that they received a complete result, when in fact they only received the first page. To support pagination (returning list results in pages) in a List method, the API shall : define a string field page_token in the List method's request message. The client uses this field to request a specific page of the list results. define an int field page_size in the List method's request message. Clients use this field to specify the maximum number of results to be returned by the server. The server may further constrain the maximum number of results returned in a single page. If the page_size is 0 , the server will decide the number of results to be returned. define a string field next_page_token in the List method's response message.

It also provides general guidance to developers on how to properly generate and handle errors. Alinea APIs use a simple protocol-agnostic error model, which allows us to offer a consistent experience across different APIs, different API protocols (such as gRPC or HTTP), and different error contexts (such as asynchronous, batch, or workflow errors). Error Model The error model for Alinea APIs is logically defined by Status , an instance of which is returned to the client when an API error occurs. The following code snippet shows the overall design of the error model: from pydantic import BaseModel class Status(BaseModel): code: int message: str details: dict Because most Alinea APIs use resource-oriented API design, the error handling follows the same design principle by using a small set of standard errors with a large number of resources. For example, instead of defining different kinds of \"not found\" errors, the server uses one standard NOT_FOUND error code and tells the client which specific resource was not found. The smaller error space reduces the complexity of documentation, affords better idiomatic mappings in client libraries, and reduces client logic complexity while not restricting the inclusion of actionable information. Error Codes Alinea APIs must use the canonical error codes defined by Code . Individual APIs must avoid defining additional error codes, since developers are very unlikely to write logic to handle a large number of error codes. For reference, handling an average of 3 error codes per API call would mean most application logic would just be for error handling, which would not be a good developer experience. Error Messages The error message should help users understand and resolve the API error easily and quickly. In general, consider the following guidelines when writing error messages: Do not assume the user is an expert user of your API. Users could be client developers, operations people, IT staff, or end-users of apps. Do not assume the user knows anything about your service implementation or is familiar with the context of the errors (such as log analysis). When possible, error messages should be constructed such that a technical user (but not necessarily a developer of your API) can respond to the error and correct it. Keep the error message brief. If needed, provide a link where a confused reader can ask questions, give feedback, or get more information that doesn't cleanly fit in an error message. Otherwise, use the details field to expand. Warning Error messages are not part of the API surface. They are subject to changes without notice. Application code must not have a hard dependency on error messages. Error Details Alinea APIs define a set of standard error payloads for error details, which you can find in error_details . These cover the most common needs for API errors, such as quota failure and invalid parameters. Like error codes, developers should use these standard payloads whenever possible. Additional error detail types should only be introduced if they can assist application code to handle the errors. If the error information can only be handled by humans, rely on the error message content and let developers handle it manually rather than introducing additional error detail types. Here are some example error_details payloads: ErrorInfo : Provides structured error information that is both stable and extensible . RetryInfo : Describes when clients can retry a failed request, may be returned on Code.UNAVAILABLE or Code.ABORTED BadRequest : Describes violations in a client request, may be returned on Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT Error Info ErrorInfo is a special kind of error payload. It provides stable and extensible error information that both humans and applications can depend on. Each ErrorInfo has 3 pieces of information: an error domain, an error reason, and a set of error metadata, such as this example . For more information, see the ErrorInfo definition. For Alinea APIs, the primary error domain is alinea.io , and the corresponding error reasons are defined by ErrorReason enum. For more information, see the ErrorReason definition. Error Localization The message field in Status is developer-facing and must be in English. If a user-facing error message is needed, use LocalizedMessage as your details field. While the message field in LocalizedMessage can be localized, ensure that the message field in Status is in English. By default, the API service should use the authenticated user\u2019s locale or HTTP Accept-Language header or the language_code parameter in the request to determine the language for the localization. Handling Errors Below is a table containing all of the error codes defined in Code and a short description of their cause. To handle an error, you can check the description for the returned status code and modify your call accordingly. HTTP gRPC Description 200 OK No error. 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT Client specified an invalid argument. Check error message and error details for more information. 400 FAILED_PRECONDITION Request can not be executed in the current system state, such as deleting a non-empty directory. 400 OUT_OF_RANGE Client specified an invalid range. 401 UNAUTHENTICATED Request not authenticated due to missing, invalid, or expired OAuth token. 403 PERMISSION_DENIED Client does not have sufficient permission. This can happen because the OAuth token does not have the right scopes, the client doesn't have permission, or the API has not been enabled. 404 NOT_FOUND A specified resource is not found. 409 ABORTED Concurrency conflict, such as read-modify-write conflict. 409 ALREADY_EXISTS The resource that a client tried to create already exists. 499 CANCELLED Request cancelled by the client. 500 DATA_LOSS Unrecoverable data loss or data corruption. The client should report the error to the user. 500 UNKNOWN Unknown server error. Typically a server bug. 500 INTERNAL Internal server error. Typically a server bug. 501 NOT_IMPLEMENTED API method not implemented by the server. 502 N/A Network error occurred before reaching the server. Typically a network outage or misconfiguration. 503 UNAVAILABLE Service unavailable. Typically the server is down. 504 DEADLINE_EXCEEDED Request deadline exceeded. This will happen only if the caller sets a deadline that is shorter than the method's default deadline (i.e. requested deadline is not enough for the server to process the request) and the request did not finish within the deadline. Warning Alinea APIs may concurrently check multiple preconditions for an API request. Returning one error code does not imply other preconditions are satisfied. Application code must not depend on the ordering of precondition checks. Retrying Errors Clients may retry on 503 UNAVAILABLE errors with exponential backoff. The minimum delay should be 1s unless it is documented otherwise. The default retry repetition should be once unless it is documented otherwise. For 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED errors, the client may retry at the higher level with minimum 30s delay. Such retries are only useful for long running background jobs. For all other errors, retry may not be applicable. First ensure your request is idempotent, and see RetryInfo for guidance. Propagating Errors If your API service depends on other services, you should not blindly propagate errors from those services to your clients. When translating errors, we suggest the following: Hide implementation details and confidential information. Adjust the party responsible for the error. For example, a server that receives an INVALID_ARGUMENT error from another service should propagate an INTERNAL to its own caller. Reproducing Errors If you cannot resolve errors through analysis of logs and monitoring, you should try to reproduce the errors with a simple and repeatable test. You can use the test to collect more information for troubleshooting, which you can provide when contacting technical support. We recommend you use oauth2l and curl -v and System Parameters to reproduce errors with Alinea APIs. Together they can reproduce almost all Alinea API requests, and provide you verbose debug information. For more information, see the respective documentation pages for the API you are calling. Note For troubleshooting, you should include &$.xgafv=2 in your request URLs to select error format v2. Some Alinea APIs use error format v1 by default for compatibility reasons. Generating Errors If you are a server developer, you should generate errors with enough information to help client developers understand and resolve the problem. At the same time, you must be aware of the security and privacy of the user data, and avoid disclosing sensitive information in the error message and error details, since errors are often logged and may be accessible by others. For example, an error message like \"Client IP address is not on allowlist 128.0.0.0/8\" exposes information about the server-side policy, which may not be accessible to the user who has access to the logs. To generate proper errors, you first need to be familiar with Code to choose the most suitable error code for each error condition. A server application may check multiple error conditions in parallel, and return the first one. The following table lists each error code and an example of a good error message. HTTP gRPC Example Error Message 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT Request field x.y.z is xxx, expected one of [yyy, zzz]. 400 FAILED_PRECONDITION Resource xxx is a non-empty directory, so it cannot be deleted. 400 OUT_OF_RANGE Parameter 'age' is out of range [0, 125]. 401 UNAUTHENTICATED Invalid authentication credentials. 403 PERMISSION_DENIED Permission 'xxx' denied on resource 'yyy'. 404 NOT_FOUND Resource 'xxx' not found. 409 ABORTED Couldn\u2019t acquire lock on resource \u2018xxx\u2019. 409 ALREADY_EXISTS Resource 'xxx' already exists. 499 CANCELLED Request cancelled by the client. 500 DATA_LOSS See note. 500 UNKNOWN See note. 500 INTERNAL See note. 501 NOT_IMPLEMENTED Method 'xxx' not implemented. 503 UNAVAILABLE See note. 504 DEADLINE_EXCEEDED See note. Note Since the client cannot fix the server error, it is not useful to generate additional error details. To avoid leaking sensitive information under error conditions, it is recommended not to generate any error message and only generate DebugInfo error details. The DebugInfo is specially designed only for server-side logging, and must not be sent to client. Error Payloads The alinea-core package defines a set of standard error payloads, which are preferred to custom error payloads. The following table lists each error code and its matching standard error payload, if applicable. We recommend advanced applications look for these error payloads in Status when they handle errors.

Since many developers are not native English speakers, one goal of these naming conventions is to ensure that the majority of developers can easily understand an API. It does this by encouraging the use of a simple, consistent, and small vocabulary when naming methods and resources. Names used in APIs should be in correct American English. For example, license (instead of licence), color (instead of colour). Commonly accepted short forms or abbreviations of long words may be used for brevity. For example, API is preferred over Application Programming Interface. Use intuitive, familiar terminology where possible. For example, when describing removing (and destroying) a resource, delete is preferred over erase. Use the same name or term for the same concept, including for concepts shared across APIs. Avoid name overloading. Use different names for different concepts. Avoid overly general names that are ambiguous within the context of the API and the larger ecosystem of Alinea APIs. They can lead to misunderstanding of API concepts. Rather, choose specific names that accurately describe the API concept. This is particularly important for names that define first-order API elements, such as resources. There is no definitive list of names to avoid, as every name must be evaluated in the context of other names. Instance, info, and service are examples of names that have been problematic in the past. Names chosen should describe the API concept clearly (for example: instance of what?) and distinguish it from other relevant concepts (for example: does \"alert\" mean the rule, the signal, or the notification?). Carefully consider use of names that may conflict with keywords in common programming languages. Such names may be used but will likely trigger additional scrutiny during API review. Use them judiciously and sparingly. Product names Product names refer to the product marketing names of APIs, such as Alinea Raw API. Product names must be consistently used by APIs, UIs, documentation, etc. Alinea APIs must use product names approved by the product teams. The table below shows examples of all related API names and their consistency. See further below on this page for more details on the respective names and their conventions. API Name Example Product Name Alinea Raw API Service Name raw.alinea.io Package Name alinea.raw.v3 Interface Name alinea.raw.v3.RawService Source Directory //alinea/raw/v3 API Name raw Service names Service names should be syntactically valid DNS names (as per RFC 1035 ) which can be resolved to one or more network addresses. The service names of public Alinea APIs follow the pattern: xxx.alinea.io . For example, the service name of the Alinea Raw is raw.alinea.io . If an API is composed of several services they should be named in a way to help discoverability. One way to do this is for the Service Names to share a common prefix. Package names Package names declared in the API files should be consistent with Product Names and Service Names. Package names should use singular component names to avoid mixed singular and plural component names. Package names must not use underscores. Package names for versioned APIs must end with the version. For example: // Alinea Raw API package alinea.raw.v3; An abstract API that isn't directly associated with a service, such as Alinea Watcher API, should use package names consistent with the Product name: // Alinea Watcher API package alinea.watcher.v1; Collection IDs Collection IDs should use plural form and lowerCamelCase , and American English spelling and semantics. For example: events , children , or deletedEvents . Interface names To avoid confusion with Service Names such as raw.alinea.io , the term interface name refers to the name used when defining a service . You can think of the service name as a reference to the actual implementation of a set of APIs, while the interface name refers to the abstract definition of an API. An interface name should use an intuitive noun such as Raw or Blob. The name should not conflict with any well-established concepts in programming languages and their runtime libraries (for example, File). In the rare case where an interface name would conflict with another name within the API, a suffix (for example Api or Service ) should be used to disambiguate. Message names Message names should be short and concise. Avoid unnecessary or redundant words. Adjectives can often be omitted if there is no corresponding message without the adjective. For example, the Shared in SharedProxySettings is unnecessary if there are no unshared proxy settings. Message names should not include prepositions (e.g. \"With\", \"For\"). Generally, message names with prepositions are better represented with optional fields on the message. Request and response messages The request and response messages for RPC methods should be named after the method names with the suffix Request and Response , respectively, unless the method request or response type is: an empty message (use Empty ), a resource type, or a resource representing an operation This typically applies to requests or responses used in standard methods Get , Create , Update , or Delete . Enum names Enum types must use UpperCamelCase names. Enum values must use CAPITALIZED_NAMES_WITH_UNDERSCORES. class FooBar(Enum): // The first value represents the default and must be == 0. FOO_BAR_UNSPECIFIED = 0; FIRST_VALUE = 1; SECOND_VALUE = 2; Field names Field definitions must use lower_case_underscore_separated_names. Field names should not include prepositions (e.g. \"for\", \"during\", \"at\"), for example: reason_for_error should instead be error_reason cpu_usage_at_time_of_failure should instead be failure_time_cpu_usage Field names should not use postpositive adjectives (modifiers placed after the noun), for example: items_collected should instead be collected_items objects_imported should instead be imported_objects Repeated field names Repeated fields in APIs must use proper plural forms. This matches the convention of existing Alinea APIs, and the common expectation of external developers. Time and Duration To represent a point in time independent of any time zone or calendar, ISO 8601 should be used, and the field name should end with time , such as start_time and end_time . If the time refers to an activity, the field name should have the form of verb_time , such as create_time , update_time . Avoid using past tense for the verb, such as created_time or last_updated_time . To represent a span of time between two points in time independent of any calendar and concepts like \"day\" or \"month\", Duration should be used. If you have to represent time-related fields using an integer type for legacy or compatibility reasons, including wall-clock time, duration, delay and latency, the field names must have the following form: xxx_{time|duration|delay|latency}_{seconds|millis|micros|nanos} send_time_millis: int receive_time_millis: int If you have to represent timestamp using string type for legacy or compatibility reasons, the field names should not include any unit suffix. The string representation should use RFC 3339 format, e.g. \"2014-07-30T10:43:17Z\". Date and Time of Day For dates that are independent of time zone and time of day, Date should be used and it should have the suffix _date . If a date must be represented as a string, it should be in the ISO 8601 date format YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 2014-07-30. For times of day that are independent of time zone and date, TimeOfDay should be used and should have the suffix _time . If a time of day must be represented as a string, it should be in the ISO 8601 24-hour time format HH:MM:SS[.FFF], e.g. 14:55:01.672. Quantities Quantities represented by an integer type must include the unit of measurement. xxx_{bytes|width_pixels|meters} If the quantity is a number of items, then the field should have the suffix _count , for example node_count . List filter field If an API supports filtering of resources returned by the List method, the field containing the filter expression should be named filter . For example: class ListBooksRequest: // The parent resource name. parent: str // The filter expression. filter: str List response The name of the field in the List method's response message, which contains the list of resources must be a plural form of the resource name itself. Name abbreviation For well known name abbreviations among software developers, such as config and spec , the abbreviations should be used in API definitions instead of the full spelling. This will make the source code easy to read and write. In formal documentations, the full spelling should be used. Examples: config (configuration) id (identifier) spec (specification) stats (statistics)","title":"Naming Convention"},{"location":"standardization/apis/naming-conventions/#product-names","text":"Product names refer to the product marketing names of APIs, such as Alinea Raw API.

Each resource must have its own unique resource name. The resource name is made up of the ID of the resource itself, the IDs of any parent resources, and its API service name. We'll look at resource IDs and how a resource name is constructed below. APIs should use scheme-less URIs for resource names. They generally follow the REST URL conventions and behave much like network file paths. They can be easily mapped to REST URLs: see the Standard Methods section for details. A collection is a special kind of resource that contains a list of sub-resources of identical type. For example, a table is a collection of row resources. The resource ID for a collection is called collection ID. The resource name is organized hierarchically using collection IDs and resource IDs, separated by forward slashes. If a resource contains a sub-resource, the sub-resource's name is formed by specifying the parent resource name followed by the sub-resource's ID - again, separated by forward slashes. Example: A raw service has a collection of databases , where each database has a collection of tables : API Service Name Collection ID Resource ID Collection ID Resource ID //raw.alinea.com/ /databases /database-id /tables /table-id An API producer can choose any acceptable value for resource and collection IDs as long as they are unique within the resource hierarchy. You can find more guidelines for choosing appropriate resource and collection IDs below. Full Resource Name A scheme-less URI consisting of a DNS-compatible API service name and a resource path. The resource path is also known as relative resource name. For example: \"//raw.alinea.com/databases/database1/tables/table2\" The API service name is for clients to locate the API service endpoint; it may be a fake DNS name for internal-only services. If the API service name is obvious from the context, relative resource names are often used. Relative Resource Name A URI path ( path-noscheme ) without the leading \"/\". It identifies a resource within the API service. For example: \"databases/database1/tables/table2\" Resource ID resource ID typically consists of one or more non-empty URI segments ( segment-nz-nc ) that identify the resource within its parent resource, see above examples. The non-trailing resource ID in a resource name must have exactly one URL segment, while the trailing resource ID in a resource name may have more than one URI segment. For example: Collection ID Resource ID files source/py/parser.py API services should use URL-friendly resource IDs when feasible. Resource IDs must be clearly documented whether they are assigned by the client, the server, or either. For example, file names are typically assigned by clients, while asset IDs are typically assigned by servers. Collection ID A non-empty URI segment ( segment-nz-nc ) identifying the collection resource within its parent resource, see above examples. Because collection IDs often appear in the generated client libraries, they must conform to the following requirements: Must be valid C/C++ identifiers. Must be in plural form with lowerCamel case. If the term doesn't have suitable plural form, such as \"evidence\" and \"weather\", the singular form should be used. Must use clear and concise English terms. Overly general terms should be avoided or qualified. For example, rowValues is preferred to values. The following terms should be avoided without qualification: elements entries instances items objects resources types values Resource Name vs URL While full resource names resemble normal URLs, they are not the same thing. A single resource can be exposed by different API versions, API protocols, or API network endpoints. The full resource name does not specify such information, so it must be mapped to a specific API version and API protocol for actual use. To use a full resource name via REST APIs, it must be converted to a REST URL by adding the HTTPS scheme before the service name, adding the API major version before the resource path, and URL-escaping the resource path. For example: // This is a database table resource name. \"//raw.alinea.com/projects/project1/databases/database1/tables/table123\" // This is the corresponding HTTP URL. \"https://raw.alinea.com/v2/projects/project1/databases/database1/tables/table123\" Resource Name as String Alinea APIs must represent resource names using plain strings, unless backward compatibility is an issue. Resource names should be handled like normal file paths. When a resource name is passed between different components, it must be treated as an atomic value and must not have any data loss. For resource definitions, the first field should be a string field for the resource name. For example: GET projects/project1/databases/database1 response: { dislay_name: database1 } Questions Q: Why not use resource IDs to identify a resource? For any large system, there are many kinds of resources. To use resource IDs to identify a resource, we actually use a resource-specific tuple to identify a resource, such as (bucket, object) or (user, album, photo) . It creates several major problems: Developers have to understand and remember such anonymous tuples. Passing tuples is generally harder than passing strings.

The architectural style of REST was introduced, primarily designed to work well with HTTP/1.1, but also to help tackle this problem. Its core principle is to define named resources that can be manipulated using a small number of methods. The resources and methods are known as nouns and verbs of APIs. With the HTTP protocol, the resource names naturally map to URLs, and methods naturally map to HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. This results in much fewer things to learn, since developers can focus on the resources and their relationship, and assume that they have the same small number of standard methods. On the Internet, HTTP REST APIs have been hugely successful. In 2010, about 74% of public network APIs were HTTP REST (or REST-like) APIs, most using JSON as the wire format. While HTTP/JSON APIs are very popular on the Internet, the amount of traffic they carry is smaller than traditional RPC APIs. For example, about half of Internet traffic in America at peak time is video content, and few people would consider using HTTP/JSON APIs to deliver such content for obvious performance reasons. Inside data centers, many companies use socket-based RPC APIs to carry most network traffic, which can involve orders of magnitude more data (measured in bytes) than public HTTP/JSON APIs. In reality, both RPC APIs and HTTP/JSON APIs are needed for various reasons, and ideally, an API platform should provide best support for all types of APIs. This Design Guide helps you design and build APIs that conform to this principle. It does so by applying resource-oriented design principles to general API design and defines many common design patterns to improve usability and reduce complexity. Note This Design Guide explains how to apply REST principles to API designs independent of programming language, operating system, or network protocol. It is NOT a guide solely to creating REST APIs. What is a REST API? A REST API is modeled as collections of individually-addressable resources (the nouns of the API). Resources are referenced with their resource names and manipulated via a small set of methods (also known as verbs or operations). Standard methods for REST APIs (also known as REST methods) are List , Get , Create , Update , and Delete . Custom methods (also known as custom verbs or custom operations ) are also available to API designers for functionality that doesn't easily map to one of the standard methods, such as database transactions. Note Custom verbs does not mean creating custom HTTP verbs to support custom methods. For HTTP-based APIs, they simply map to the most suitable HTTP verbs. Design Flow The Design Guide suggests taking the following steps when designing resource- oriented APIs (more details are covered in specific sections below): Determine what types of resources an API provides. Determine the relationships between resources. Decide the resource name schemes based on types and relationships. Decide the resource schemas. Attach minimum set of methods to resources. Resources A resource-oriented API is generally modeled as a resource hierarchy, where each node is either a simple resource or a collection resource . For convenience, they are often called a resource and a collection, respectively. A collection contains a list of resources of the same type . For example, a user has a collection of contacts. A resource has some state and zero or more sub-resources. Each sub-resource can be either a simple resource or a collection resource. For example, Gmail API has a collection of users, each user has a collection of messages, a collection of threads, a collection of labels, a profile resource, and several setting resources. While there is some conceptual alignment between storage systems and REST APIs, a service with a resource-oriented API is not necessarily a database, and has enormous flexibility in how it interprets resources and methods. For example, creating a calendar event (resource) may create additional events for attendees, send email invitations to attendees, reserve conference rooms, and update video conference schedules. Methods The key characteristic of a resource-oriented API is that it emphasizes resources (data model) over the methods performed on the resources (functionality). A typical resource-oriented API exposes a large number of resources with a small number of methods. The methods can be either the standard methods or custom methods. For this guide, the standard methods are: List , Get , Create , Update , and Delete . Where API functionality naturally maps to one of the standard methods, that method should be used in the API design. For functionality that does not naturally map to one of the standard methods, custom methods may be used. Custom methods offer the same design freedom as traditional RPC APIs, which can be used to implement common programming patterns, such as database transactions or data analysis. Examples The following sections present a few real world examples on how to apply resource-oriented API design to large scale services. In these examples, the asterisk indicates one specific resource out of the list. RAW API The RAW API service implements the RAW API and exposes most of RAW functionality. It has the following resource model: API service: raw A collection of databases: projects/*/databases/* A collection of tabels: projects/*/databases/*/tables/* A collection of row: projects/*/databases/*/tables/*/rows/* A collection of labels: projects/*/databases/*/labels/* A collection of change history: projects/*/databases/*/history/* Assets API The Asset service implements the Asset API, which defines the following resource model: API service: Assets A collection of assets: projects/*/assets/* A collection of subscriptions: projects/*/assets/*/lables/* Cloud Spanner API The Data Set service implements the Data Set API, which defines the following resource model: API service: dataset A collection of datasets: projects/*/datasets/* Detail information about datasets: projects/*/datasets/*/detail/ A collection of columns: projects/*/datasets/*/labels/*","title":"Resource Oriented Design"},{"location":"standardization/apis/resource-oriented-design/#what-is-a-rest-api","text":"A REST API is modeled as collections of individually-addressable resources (the nouns of the API).

Standard methods reduce complexity and increase consistency. The following table describes how to map standard methods to HTTP methods: Standard Method HTTP Mapping HTTP Request Body HTTP Response Body List GET N/A Resource* list Get GET N/A Resource* Create POST Resource Resource* Update PUT or PATCH Resource Resource* Delete DELETE N/A Empty** * The resource returned from List , Get , Create , and Update methods may contain partial data if the methods support response field masks, which specify a subset of fields to be returned. In some cases, the API platform natively supports field masks for all methods. ** The response returned from a Delete method that doesn't immediately remove the resource (such as updating a flag or creating a long-running delete operation) should contain either the long-running operation or the modified resource. A standard method may also return a long running operation for requests that do not complete within the time-span of the single API call. The following sections describe each of the standard methods in detail. List The List method takes a collection name and zero or more parameters as input, and returns a list of resources that match the input. List is commonly used to search for resources. List is suited to data from a single collection that is bounded in size and not cached. For broader cases, the custom method Search should be used. A batch get (such as a method that takes multiple resource IDs and returns an object for each of those IDs) should be implemented as a custom BatchGet method, rather than a List . However, if you have an already-existing List method that provides the same functionality, you may reuse the List method for this purpose instead. If you are using a custom BatchGet method, it should be mapped to HTTP GET. Applicable common patterns: pagination , result ordering . Applicable naming conventions: filter field , results field HTTP mapping: The List method must use an HTTP GET verb. The request message field(s) receiving the name of the collection whose resources are being listed should map to the URL path. If the collection name maps to the URL path, the last segment of the URL template (the collection ID ) must be literal. All remaining request message fields shall map to the URL query parameters. There is no request body; the API configuration must not declare a body clause. The response body should contain a list of resources along with optional metadata. Get The Get method takes a resource name, zero or more parameters, and returns the specified resource. HTTP mapping: The Get method must use an HTTP GET verb. The request message field(s) receiving the resource name should map to the URL path. All remaining request message fields shall map to the URL query parameters. There is no request body; the API configuration must not declare a body clause. The returned resource shall map to the entire response body. Create The Create method takes a parent resource name, a resource, and zero or more parameters. It creates a new resource under the specified parent, and returns the newly created resource. If an API supports creating resources, it should have a Create method for each type of resource that can be created. HTTP mapping: The Create method must use an HTTP POST verb. The request message should have a field parent that specifies the parent resource name where the resource is to be created. The request message field containing the resource must map to the HTTP request body. The request may contain a field named <resource>_id to allow callers to select a client assigned id. This field may be inside the resource. All remaining request message fields shall map to the URL query parameters. The returned resource shall map to the entire HTTP response body. If the Create method supports client-assigned resource name and the resource already exists, the request should either fail with error code ALREADY_EXISTS or use a different server-assigned resource name and the documentation should be clear that the created resource name may be different from that passed in. The Create method must take an input resource, so that when the resource schema changes, there is no need to update both request schema and resource schema. For resource fields that cannot be set by the clients, they must be documented as \"Output only\" fields. Update The Update method takes a request message containing a resource and zero or more parameters. It updates the specified resource and its properties, and returns the updated resource. Mutable resource properties should be mutable by the Update method, except the properties that contain the resource's name or parent . Any functionality to rename or move a resource must not happen in the Update method and instead shall be handled by a custom method. HTTP mapping: The standard Update method should support partial resource update, and use HTTP verb PATCH with a FieldMask field named update_mask . Output fields that are provided by the client as inputs should be ignored. An Update method that requires more advanced patching semantics, such as appending to a repeated field, should be made available by a custom method . If the Update method only supports full resource update, it must use HTTP verb PUT . However, full update is highly discouraged because it has backwards compatibility issues when adding new resource fields. The message field receiving the resource name must map to the URL path. The field may be in the resource message itself. The request message field containing the resource must map to the request body. All remaining request message fields must map to the URL query parameters. The response message must be the updated resource itself. If the API accepts client-assigned resource names, the server may allow the client to specify a non-existent resource name and create a new resource. Otherwise, the Update method should fail with non-existent resource name. The error code NOT_FOUND should be used if it is the only error condition. An API with an Update method that supports resource creation should also provide a Create method. Rationale is that it is not clear how to create resources if the Update method is the only way to do it. Delete The Delete method takes a resource name and zero or more parameters, and deletes or schedules for deletion the specified resource. The Delete method should return Empty . An API should not rely on any information returned by a Delete method, as it cannot be invoked repeatedly. HTTP mapping: The Delete method must use an HTTP DELETE verb. The request message field(s) receiving the resource name should map to the URL path. All remaining request message fields shall map to the URL query parameters. There is no request body; the API configuration must not declare a body clause. If the Delete method immediately removes the resource, it should return an empty response. If the Delete method initiates a long-running operation, it should return the long-running operation. If the Delete method only marks the resource as being deleted, it should return the updated resource. Calls to the Delete method should be idempotent in effect, but do not need to yield the same response. Any number of Delete requests should result in a resource being (eventually) deleted, but only the first request should result in a success code. Subsequent requests should result in a NOT_FOUND .","title":"Standard Methods"},{"location":"standardization/apis/standard-methods/#list","text":"The List method takes a collection name and zero or more parameters as input, and returns a list of resources that match the input. List is commonly used to search for resources. List is suited to data from a single collection that is bounded in size and not cached. For broader cases, the custom method Search should be used. A batch get (such as a method that takes multiple resource IDs and returns an object for each of those IDs) should be implemented as a custom BatchGet method, rather than a List . However, if you have an already-existing List method that provides the same functionality, you may reuse the List method for this purpose instead. If you are using a custom BatchGet method, it should be mapped to HTTP GET. Applicable common patterns: pagination , result ordering . Applicable naming conventions: filter field , results field HTTP mapping: The List method must use an HTTP GET verb. The request message field(s) receiving the name of the collection whose resources are being listed should map to the URL path. If the collection name maps to the URL path, the last segment of the URL template (the collection ID ) must be literal. All remaining request message fields shall map to the URL query parameters.

In order to use and control such functionality, the platform pre-defines a special set of request parameters called system parameters. These parameters are available across all Alinea REST APIs. A system parameter can be specified either using an HTTP query parameter or an HTTP header. Most users will not need to use these parameters directly. However, they are often used by Alinea-provided client libraries. If you need to write custom code to access Alinea APIs directly, the system parameters can be useful in cases such as controlling JSON pretty-printing or specifying API Keys. HTTP Mapping For HTTP requests, system parameters are sent as URL query parameters or HTTP request headers. For example, if you have a system parameter $foo , it's sent as ?$foo=xxx in the URL, or ?%24foo=xxx if URL-encoded. See the table below for details. Note The $ name prefix is added to avoid conflicting with normal request parameters. Definitions The following table lists all system parameters and their definitions.
