Alinea is an open source data collection platform that can be used on the `edge` as well in the `cloud`. An important part of the design is to make it with the minimum of lock in effects as possible. Some lockin will usualy be needed and those parts will be highlightet as part of the documentation. Alltough some lock in issues might be solved by having clearly defined interfaces where adapters can be created or use communication protocols where those can be standarized.
