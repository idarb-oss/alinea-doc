## Why

In a world where collecting data and get valid descision making out of those data is getting more and more available, there are still lots of issues around how this can be done in the industries. Some part of this is that `cloud` dose not solve everything, there are clear issues with latency and the speed of data collection to decission making (depending on what needs decission is beeing done).

There are standards that are beeing talked about and companies tries to take into use, but most often they ends up as `buzz words` and we most often end up in the same habit as we always are in. One of these are [Industry 4.0](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Navigation/EN/Industrie40/WhatIsIndustrie40/what-is-industrie40.html) that has been out there for a long time and the term was first used in `2011`. In `Industry 4.0` is all about Aritifial Inteligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and so forth that in many cases are not so straight forward as we would like it to be.

`Industry 4.0` are an important and necessary way, but it is hard to achive. And the reason for this seems to be mostly of little open standards and vendors that wants to make it hard for the producing industry. Most of the industry out there are not companies hiering developers that devlop their own software/hardware or any other type of the needed parts of the large puzzle. Since this would be very expensive in the long run.

Another part of the industries today is that they are heavily base on `shareholder value` and forget one `big` part of it all the `stackeholder value`. This way of thinking seems to be one of the large issues for the youth today as they are looking for something else. This seems to be why another _buzz word_ is started and that is [Industry 5.0](https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/industry-50_en). There is also a most on `Medium` by Dr. Marcell Vollmer back in 2018[^1]

> Industry 5.0 is characterised by going beyond producing goods and services for profit. It shifts the focus from the shareholder value to stakeholder value and reinforces the role and the contribution of industry to society.

## Multiplicity Issue

One thing with `Industry 4.0` is that is higly based on everything from artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), robotics, Internet of Things (IoT) etc.. tough lot of the industires today are not new factories based on higly advanced new technologies from the start. Event factory building are not necessary created to install new robotics.

This also puts an issue onto how many machines do we have of one type. `Windmills` the typical case that is visualized every where for to business owners is not the case in most industries. Maybe if your lucky you might have an hand full of similar machines. This puts on the case, how mutch effort and resources (people and money) should be put into that 'one' machine.
