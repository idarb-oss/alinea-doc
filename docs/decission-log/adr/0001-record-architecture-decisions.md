## Context

As this will be a system with many components and decisions it is necessary to log all architecture decisions in one place.

## Decision

For all architectural decisions Architecture Decision Log (ADL) is created. All decisions will be recorded as Architecture Decision Records (ADR).

Each ADR will be recorded using [Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) template, which contains at least the following sections: Status, Context, Decision and Consequences.

## Consequences

All architectural decisions should be recorded in log. Old decisions should be recorded as well with an approximate decision date. New decisions should be recorded on a regular basis.
