## Context

Modules/Services needs to use an common architecture to make it more easy to understand the source code to all of them.

## Decision

We have decided to use _Feature Slicing_ also called _Vertical Slices_. This easier to find what belongs to what feature and keeps that what belongs to each other closer.

## Consequences

TBD

## References
