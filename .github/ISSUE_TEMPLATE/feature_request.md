### First check

* [ ] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
* [ ] I used the GitHub search to find a similar issue and didn't find it.
* [ ] I searched the Alinea documentation, with the integrated search.
* [ ] I already searched in Google "How to X in Alinea" and didn't find any information.
* [ ] I already read and followed all the tutorial in the docs and didn't find an answer.
* [ ] After submitting this, I commit to:
    * Read open issues with questions until I find 2 issues where I can help someone and add a comment to help there.
    * Or, I already hit the "watch" button in this repository to receive notifications and I commit to help at least 2 people that ask questions in the future.
    * Implement a Pull Request for a confirmed bug.

### Example

Here's a self-contained [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) with my use case:

<!-- Replace the code below with your own self-contained, minimal, reproducible, example -->

```Python
from Alinea import Alinea
```

### Description

<!-- Replace the content below with your own feature request -->

* Open the browser and call the endpoint `/`.
* It returns a JSON with `{"Hello": "World"}`.
* I would like it to have an extra parameter to teleport me to the moon and back.

### The solution you would like

<!-- Replace this with your own content -->

I would like it to have a `teleport_to_moon` parameter that defaults to `False`, and can be set to `True` to teleport me:

```Python
from Alinea import Alinea
```

### Describe alternatives you've considered

<!-- Replace this with your own ideas -->

To wait for Space X moon travel plans to drop down long after they release them. But I would rather teleport.

### Environment

* OS: [e.g. Linux / Windows / macOS]:
* Alinea Version [e.g. 0.3.0]:
* Python version:

To know the Python version use:

```bash
python --version
```
